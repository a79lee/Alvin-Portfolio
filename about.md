I recently graduated with a Co-op Computer Science degree from the University of Waterloo.

I'm passionate about games and game development, especially the design side of things. Presently designing, prototyping, and iteratively play-testing a board game and working towards getting it published.

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and games, reading, listening to music, watching movies, and trying food from different cultures!
