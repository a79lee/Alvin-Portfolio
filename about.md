I am a recent graduate of the Computer Science Co-op program at the University of Waterloo.

I'm passionate about games and game development, especially the design side of things. Currently designing, prototyping, and play-testing <a href="Https://www.cloudfallstudios.com">Captain's Gambit</a> and working towards getting it published.

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and games, reading, listening to music, watching movies, and trying food from different cultures!
