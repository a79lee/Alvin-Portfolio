One of the games I played this week was Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The Call of Duty series is one I haven’t visited in a while, not because I don’t enjoy it (I can’t even count the number of hours we put into that game, and its sequels) but because recently the game experiences I have been searching for differ from what the military shooter offers.<!--more--> Playing it again brings back so many great memories of the time when we (me, my brother and two of our friends) used to play split screen multiplayer (an unfortunately dying trend) every weekend. The interactions it brought out of the four of us was something online multiplayer could never replicate, which is ironic given Call of Duty was one of the games that helped popularize online gaming on consoles. Revisiting this game makes me feel quite nostalgic for the days when we played this game, and when split screen gaming was still popular (Goldeneye, anyone?). We used to have 2 v 2 matches with randomized teams on some of the smaller to medium sized maps like shipment, crash, crossfire and ambush. We had so much fun with the game we even created our own game mode when the standard TDM (Team Deathmatch) just wasn’t cutting it anymore. Even though our make-believe game modes couldn’t enforce a winning or losing team, it created some of the best memories we had playing with the game. This is a game I would absolutely recommend to anyone who likes playing first person shooters, especially at the time it was released.

### What I Look for in a Game Review

Revisiting Call of Duty 4 made me think about what I look for when I read reviews for a game. Whenever I enjoy a game, I usually recommend it to friends who enjoy that particular genre, or if game offers an experience they would like. When I read reviews, I like them to sound like a friend recommending a game, and telling me about their playing experience. This requires the player to speak a bit about the what the game offers, talking about gameplay mechanics or other features. For example, nonsensical shenanigans in GTA, or recounting an epic kill streak in COD. If a review only talks about the objective parts of the game, instead of also mentioning how the reviewer had fun with the game, the review doesn’t give enough insight and is not as convincing overall. The best reviews are those that involve both objective and subjective opinions.
