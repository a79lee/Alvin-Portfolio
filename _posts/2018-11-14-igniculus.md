Child of Light’s combat system really ‘shines’ thanks to the way Igniculus’ slowing mechanic harmonizes with the combat timeline. <!--more-->

## How the Combat System Works

In the game, each character participating in the battle progresses along a timeline until they reach the “action section”, where they then choose an action and wait the time it takes to perform it. The character performs the action once they reach the end of the timeline, before resetting to their original position and beginning their progression again. Separate from that, players have the ability to move Igniculus in real time and shine his light to slow down an enemy’s progression towards and during the “action section” in exchange for consumption of a “light meter”.

## Igniculus

This slowing mechanic offers players a lot of choice in how they approach combat setups and allows players to adapt their strategy as the battle progresses. This is further emphasized by the light meter's consumption pausing when players are choosing an action for their character, giving players the chance to evaluate the state of the timeline and decide who they want to target next. For example, players can choose to only slow down one specific enemy to focus their efforts on eliminating them first. However, they can also use it opportunistically by slowing down an enemy in the “action section”, since a successful attack on an enemy when they are in the action section interrupts the enemy’s own attack, pushing them back on the timeline. 

Without Igniculus’ slowing mechanic, players wouldn’t have as much control over which enemy they want to target or what playstyle they wish to employ during combat. The combat timeline mechanic alone would have forced players to constantly use their actions to react to the enemy’s attacks, and would take away any agency they might have during combat.
