A 2D, narrative driven, punch out style game created in Unity for Rita Orji's research into youth binge drinking. <!--more--> The game mixes JRPG style dialogue sequences with combat sequences. The narrative explores the effects of drinking on a person's psyche and social life, and changes based on how often the player drinks throughout the course of the game. When a player drinks during the combat sequences, they get armor that reduces the demon's damage. The combat gameplay is similar to punch out, where players use attacks/dodges to defeat enemies. I functioned both as a designer and programmer for team.

### My Role(s):

Programmer: 
* I built most of the levels, and put the game together. 
* I added most of the animations, all of the music and UI into the game. 
* I modified the underlying systems and mechanics created by the previous programmer, such as the combat mechanics and BAC system, to fit the design vision.

Designer: 
* Helped shape key design elements, such as deciding that dodging demon attacks also damaged demon instead of just nullifying the demon's attack. 
* Helped tune attack and health values for both the demons and player.
