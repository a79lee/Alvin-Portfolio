Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow is one I am quite familiar with as someone who plays a lot of multiplayer games as well as sports. Using agon, or competition, as a means to draw out the mental state is something I enjoying doing on a regular basis. Although I did not know the name of what I was experiencing until I learned about it in my Games Studies class, it is something I am very familiar with.

One of the most prominent ways I enter a state of Flow is when I play sports, specifically soccer. I play soccer (or football as it is known around the world) on a regular basis and am quite involved with the sport as a whole. Not only do I play a lot (multiple times a week during the summer, and one to two times a week during the winter), I also coach kids aged 11-14 during the summer too. Needless to say I am quite familiar with the sport, which means I have a degree of skill in it, which is required to enter the state of flow. I’ve noticed a significant difference when I play in actual competitions as opposed to when I play in pickup games. In pickup games, entering the state of flow is not as easy since the challenge isn’t there but it’s a different story when it comes to playing in actual competition. More often than not, when I play in a competitive setting, the occasion draws out the mental state in me and it’s something that I enjoy immensely. Every time somebody asks me why I enjoy playing the sport so much, and every time one of the reasons I tell them is because when I play I enter this state of mind, where I play solely on instinct and all distractions, including a conscious thought process, are gone. When this feeling takes over, I almost take a back seat to what I do, simultaneously realizing what I am doing while I am doing it. Sometimes some of the most wonderful moments I have had with the sport has come as a result of this focus. There have been many times when I am able to do things while playing in this state that I thought was beyond my ability.

Games are another way I enter the state of flow. Although this mostly happens when I play competitive games such as Call of Duty or Battlefront, it also has happened when I played single player games that have more of an emphasis on skill. An example of this is Flappy Bird. When I first played the game, it took some time to get used to the mechanics of the game but as I became more adept, I started entering the state of flow when I was playing it. Revisiting the game now (the game is no longer available to download but I kept it on my phone since it is a game I occasionally play) takes me right back into the state of flow. When I play, all I am focused on is timing the flaps right, paying special attention to how close the bird is to the pipes or the ground. The game draws out the focus required to enter flow out of me and is one of the reasons why I still have it on my phone. Games like Flappy Bird or Battlefront that allow me enter flow are one of the prominent reasons why I play video games. I continue to seek out experiences like these that allow me to enter flow and look forward to more games that can bring about flow.
