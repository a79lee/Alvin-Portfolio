Last year, I had the unique opportunity to develop a prototype in conjunction with the Games Institute within the University of Waterloo. I was approached by a friend, Shawn, asking if I was open to helping him develop a prototype for the Games Institute and the Stratford Theatre Festival. I was initially <!--more-->hesitant to accept given the size of the project and my inexperience, but in the end I decided to give it a try and I'm quite glad that I did! I learned more about Unity throughout the process, especially the UI tools which I used quite a bit during the development of the prototype, and had the wonderful opportunity to help showcase the game at the Waterloo Innovation Summit!

### A Little Background

Shawn is a member of the Games Institute, and a part of his thesis explored the intersection between narrative and gameplay in games. One of the games he theorized was *Places, Please!*, a 4 player co-operative mobile game designed to simulate the act of putting on a theatre production. The game tied into his research as it explored emergent narrative.


### *Places, Please!* - A Quick Overview

*Places, Please!* tasks 4 players with taking on the roles of 4 different departments that are essential to running a theatre production. They are Crew, Stage Manager, Actor and Tech. The game is divided into different "scenes" which act like the rounds of the game. In each scene the 4 departments are randomly tasked with timed minigames called "moments" that simulate tasks that could occur while a theatre production is going. The moments are random for each scene and are either completed solo or as a duo, trio or quartet. 

An example of a solo moment is called Dead Battery, where the tech player has to tap the dead mic, switch off the battery pack of the dead mic, and turn on the battery pack of a new mic. Things get really interesting in the duo, trio or quartet moments. The game requires the 4 players to be in the same room when playing because certain multiplayer moments require in person verbal communication to achieve. For example, one moment, Cueing, tasks the stage manager to cue the tech player to press the GO button on their screen. The only way to notify the tech player is to physically tell him in person. Moments have to be finished within the time limit and the faster a moment is finished, the more points are gained. If the player takes too long to finish, a meter representing the house lights fills, with the maximum penalty given if they are unable to finish within the time limit. If the house lights meter maxes out, the show is stopped and the players lose.  

### The Prototype

Creating the protoype was a great learning experience for me. I worked as the lead developer with 2 different programmers. Initially, we compared different platforms throughout the brainstorming process and settled on Unity. We liked the ability to build on both android and iOS devices for testing.  

Shawn designed the game in its entirety, but given the timeframe we had to build the prototype, he tasked us with creating only one fully playable scene for the prototype. The idea of the prototype was to get across the type of interactions between the players. Some of the moments we implemented were:

+ **Wig Prep:** This moment tasks players with swiping down on the red mannequins to prepare them for the actors

+ **Understudy Guide:** This moment involves the stage manager and the actor. The stage manager's screen is presented with a map and a series of dots that form a path that they have to trace over with their finger. As a dot is swiped by the stage manager, the actor, who is presented with the same screen but without the dots initially, is able to see the dots that form the path which must also be traced.

+ **Costume Change:** This is also another duo moment, this time consisting of the crew and the actor. The crew gets a piece of clothing that he must "pass" onto the actor by tilting their device. To receive the piece of clothing, the actor must also tilt their device after the crew player has done so. The actor will then be presented with arrows, which they will have to swipe to signify them putting it on.

### Pitching and Demoing

Once the prototype was finally finished, I was invited by Shawn to join him when he pitched the prototype to the Stratford Theatre Festival. I went with him to Stratford and helped setup the demo and was on hand to help answer any questions they had throughout the presentation. I've had some previous experience with pitching during one of my previous co-op terms but this was the first time I was a part of a formal pitch. It was quite fun and it was a great experience!

One of the best experiences by far that was brought on by the project was also being asked by Shawn to help demo the prototype during the Waterloo Innovation Summit. The summit is a multiday event that spans multiple venues. We were located at a museum in Kitchener and the Games Institute had the whole second floor to themselves.

This was my first time ever attending an event like this. It was all very exciting! We had our own booth and a poster too.

Overall, I'm quite happy with how the prototype turned out and the experiences that participating in the project offered me. Heres to hoping more projects like this come around in the future!
