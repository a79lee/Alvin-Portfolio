Duolingo is an example of gamification used to “enhance” the learning experience. Learning a new language is always hard and only gets harder as an adult. From my experience with the game/app so far, the design of the learning app is very similar to how many free-to-play mobile games are designed: to keep up user retention. For example, users have an overall XP bar to gauge their performance. The better a user performs in the lessons the more XP they gain,<!--more--> which in turn levels them up. It adds RPG elements to the learning process as an incentive to keep using the app, and plays on our inherent instinct to want to see bars fill up and track our forward progress. This design element is used in many games to keep the player interested and invested in the game (or app in this case). Another design element used to entice users to continue is showing how long the player has kept up their "day streak". When users finish a lesson, they are shown a screen that keeps track of how many consecutive days they have kept up with their lessons. This element further plays on our inherent behaviour. We inherently want to keep streaks going, and feel bad when we stop, which is also what free-to-play mobile games do.

Duolingo developers have learned from the success of the free-to-play mobile industry, and have applied the same principles to gamify learning a new language. Whether or not the app can successfully teach a user a new language is hard to gauge given my small amount of time with it, but based on the success of the free-to-play mobile industry, I expect users will learn from repetition as they constantly revisit the app, and I am giving Duolingo overall the benefit of the doubt.
