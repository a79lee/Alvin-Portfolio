Duolingo is an example of gamification used to “enhance” the learning experience. Learning a new language is always hard and only gets harder as an adult so any help in the regard is always good. From my experience with the game/app so far, the design of the learning app is very similar to how many free to play mobile games are designed, to keep up user retention. For example, users have an overall XP bar that gauges how their performance is. The better they do in the lessons the more XP they gain which in turn levels them up, which is similar to many free to play games. It adds RPG elements to the learning process as an incentive to keep using the app. It plays on our inherent instinct of wanting to see bars fill up to help track our forward progress. This design element is used in many games to keep the player interested and invested in games (or app in this case). Another design element used to entice users to keep going is showing how long the player has kept up their day streak. When users finish a lesson, they are shown a screen that keeps track of how many consecutive days they have kept up with their lessons. This element further plays on our inherent behaviour wanting to keep streaks going, and feeling bad when we stopped, which is also what free to play mobile games do.

Duolingo takes the lessons learned from what made the free to play mobile industry so successful and tries to apply it to learning a new language. Whether its successful or not at teaching a user a new language is hard to gauge given my small amount of time with it this far but based on the success of the free to play mobile industry, I would give it the benefit of the doubt.
