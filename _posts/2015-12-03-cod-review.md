One of the games I played this week was Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The Call of Duty series is one I haven’t visited in a while, not because I don’t enjoy it (I can’t even count the number of hours we put into that game, and its sequels) but because recently the game experiences I have been searching for differ from what the military shooter offers. Playing it again brings back so many great memories of the time when we (me, my brother and a two of our friends) used to play split screen multiplayer (an unfortunately dying trend) every weekend. The interactions it brought out of the four of us was something online multiplayer could never replicate, even though Call of Duty was one of the games that helped popularize online gaming on consoles. Revisiting this game makes me feel quite nostalgic for the days when we played this game, and when split screen gaming was still popular (Goldeneye anyone?). We used to have 2 v 2 matches with randomized teams on some of the smaller to medium sized maps like shipment, crash, crossfire and ambush. We had so much fun with the game we even created our own game mode when the standard TDM(Team Deathmatch) wasn’t cutting it anymore. Even though our make believe game modes couldn’t enforce a winning or losing team, it created some of the best memories we had playing with the game.

This is a game I would absolutely (especially at the time it came out) recommend to anyone who liked playing first person shooters. Playing this once more made me think about what I look for when I read reviews for a game. Whenever I enjoy a game, I usually recommend it to friends who I know enjoy a particular genre or if I know the game offers an experience they would like. When I read reviews, I like it to sound like a friend telling me how great a game is, and that involves telling me about their experience with the game. From doing nonsensical shenanigans in GTA to recounting an epic kill streak in COD. All of this requires them to speak a bit about the what the game offers the players, like talking about gameplay mechanics or other features. But as great as talking about the objective parts of the game is, not talking about how they had fun with the game doesn’t give me enough insight and is not as convincing. The best reviews are those that involve a bit of the objective and a bit of the subjective.
