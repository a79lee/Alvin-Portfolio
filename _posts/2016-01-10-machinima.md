Back in second year, I took a machinima course. For those who don't know what machinima is, it is basically the use of a video game engine to create films. It was one of the most unique courses I had ever taken and taught me quite a bit about the process of making a movie. Crafting the story for the short film was a fun experience and I wanted to detail a bit about the process.

The course was structured in such a way that each assignment was a step toward finishing the final film. I had to choose one of Aesop's fables and create a more modern take on it. The one I chose was The boy and The Nettles, which had the lesson "Whatever you do, do with all your might".

The first thing I had to do was create a beat sheet. A beat is basically the smallest unit of a story. Each beat is a piece of the story where something happens that pushes the story forward. The class was told to create the beat sheet on sticky notes so that we could rearrange them whenever we felt the story needed it.

The next step was to create a storyboard and present it to the class. I used the storyboard to plan out how the story would unfold. I included details like the type of shots for each scene, the length and what kind of dialogue would take place during each scene if any. I got feedback on it from the rest of the class on areas where I could improve on when making the final product.

Next, we put it all together and created the film. Using a program called MovieStorm, we manually created all the sets, the characters. We also had to setup the animations for the characters by doing things like tracing each character's path of movement, moving their heads so they were looking at the proper thing at a given time or other actions they would partake in a scene. We had a camera that we could manipulate to get the shots we needed as well. This whole process took alot of time, and was very frustrating since alot of the time it felt like a battle to make MovieStorm do what we wanted. I also had to edit all the shots, and put everything together. This didn't leave much time for recording audio, so I used a text-to-speech program as a place holder for the voices, hoping I would be able to re-record them. The text-to-speech voices honestly made the video quite funny. Unforunately I never got a chance to put actual voices in it. I wish I could go back and redo the voices but unfortunately my license for MovieStorm expired. 


Overall I enjoyed the process alot and I'm happy with how it turned out bar the voice recordings. I put alot of work into planning and executing the shots and fighting with MovieStorm to get what I needed, and I learned quite alot from creating the short film.
