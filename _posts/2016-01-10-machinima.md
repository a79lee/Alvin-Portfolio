Back in second year, I took a machinima course. For those who don't know what machinima is, it is essentially the use of a video game engine to create films. It was one of the most unique courses I have ever taken and taught me quite a bit about the process of making a movie. Crafting the story for the short film was a fun experience and I want to detail a bit about the process in this post.

The course was structured in such a way that each assignment was a step toward finishing the final film. I had to choose one of Aesop's fables and create a more modern take on it. The one I chose was The boy and The Nettles, which had the lesson "Whatever you do, do with all your might".

The first thing I did was create a beat sheet. A beat is basically the smallest unit of a story. Each beat is a piece of the story where something happens that pushes the story forward. The first step in the process was to create the beat sheet on sticky notes so that we could rearrange them whenever we felt the story needed it.

The next step was to create a storyboard and present it to the class. I used the storyboard to plan out how the story would unfold. FIX THIS: SENTNECE?I included details like the type of shots for each scene, the length and what kind of dialogue would take place during each scene if any. I received feedback from the rest of the class on areas where I could improve when making the final product.

Next, I put it all together and created the film. Using a program called MovieStorm, I manually created all the sets and the characters. I also setup the animations for the characters by tracing each character's path of movement, moving their heads so they were looking at a specified direction at a given time or other actions they would take in a scene. I manipulated an in game camera to get the shots I needed. This process took a lot of time, especially since I needed to familiarize myself with the software and its limitations. I also edited all the shots to make everything coherent to the audience. Given more time, I would improve the overall presentation by recording the audio with real people and spending more time on improving the animation for certain characters or scenes. I would even consider using another engine to better realize my idea.


Overall I enjoyed the process a lot and I'm happy with how it turned out bar the voice recordings. I put a lot of work into planning and executing the shots and fighting with MovieStorm to get what I needed, and I learned quite a lot from creating the short film.
