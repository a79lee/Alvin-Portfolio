<a href="Https://www.cloudfallstudios.com">Captain's Gambit</a> is a Shakespeare inspired social deception card game that tasks players with completing their secret character objective in order to win. <!--more--> Players also get 2 secret permit cards, which are powerful abilities to help them on the way to achieving their objective. Since the permit cards are only known to the player, they are allowed (and encouraged) to bluff the ownership of permit cards in order to use its effects, but if someone calls them out on it, they'll take damage. 

This game started off as a class project where our group was tasked with creating a board game that combined Shakespeare and space. We noticed that a theme of deception occured throughout many of Shakespeare's plays and wanted to translate that into the mechanics. The game takes inspiration from other social deception games such as Ultimate Werewolf, Coup, and The Resistance. Since then, we've continued to iterate on the board game's design, scope and mechanics. We are currently running playtests and iterating on the game while we ramp up towards a kickstarter campaign.

There was a lot of emphasis in creating character objectives that each offered a different play experience. We also spent a lot of time testing and tuning the character objectives to allow for flexibility in the player's approach to completing them.For example, Puck's objective allows players to play passively, spending their time deducing the other player's objectives and manipulating them in order to prevent them from completing their objective. However, players can also choose to take a more aggressive approach by killing players before they can win.
