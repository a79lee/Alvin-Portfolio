![FINE229 - Representational](https://github.com/a79lee/Alvin-Portfolio/blob/master/images/A_Lee_representational.png?raw=true "Representational Image") ![FINE229 - Abstract](https://github.com/a79lee/Alvin-Portfolio/blob/master/images/A_Lee_abstract-01.tif?raw=true "Abstraction from the Representational Image")



My idea for this project was centralized around my love for playing soccer. I have been playing the sport since I was four and it has really influenced me in a big way and because of that I wanted to express that influence creatively though the image. The representational image shows a goal being scored, I wanted to capture this since it reflects the position I play on the field. I also used this image because I am trying to capture the elation of playing on the field and scoring an important goal for my team. The image also serves a second purpose. It is also supposed to represent overcoming your obstacles (in this case the defender and the goalie) and achieving your goals. The image I created was based on a photograph I took on the field I was playing in. I was also heavily inspired by Kota Ezawaâ€™s work and  his style for his images which are very graphic in nature which is why I wanted to create a more graphic/cartoony image as opposed to one that was more realistic. For my abstract image I abstracted a part of my representational image, namely a bit of the mesh, goal and the background. I wanted the mesh to almost represent something you have to breakthrough to get to freedom, which is the background.
