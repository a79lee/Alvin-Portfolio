![FINE229 - Representational]({{ site.baseurl }}images/A_Lee_representational.png?raw=true "Representational Image")

My idea for this project was centralized around my love for playing soccer. I have been playing the sport since I was four and it has really influenced me in a big way. I wanted to express that influence creatively. The representational image, based on a photograph I took, shows a player scoring a goal. I wanted to capture this since it reflects the position I play on the field. I also used this image because it captures the elation I feel when playing on the field and scoring an important goal for my team.<!--more-->

![FINE229 - Abstract]({{ site.baseurl }}images/A_Lee_abstract-01.png?raw=true "Abstraction from the Representational Image")

The image also serves a second purpose: It is also represents overcoming your obstacles (in this case the defender and the goalie) and achieving your goals. I was also heavily inspired by Kota Ezawaâ€™s work and his style for his images which are very graphic in nature. I wanted to emulate this style and create a more graphic/cartoon-style image. For my abstract image I abstracted a part of my representational image, namely a bit of the mesh, goal and the background. I wanted the mesh to almost represent something you have to break through to get to freedom.
